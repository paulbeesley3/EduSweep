Main Window
###########

Once EduSweep has been started, you will be presented with its main window
(shown below). It is divided into three sections: the toolbar, the task list and
the tools area; we will look at each of these in turn later.
First of all, a note for users of the older EduSweep 1.0 releases: you will notice
that the interface is substantially different to previous versions. While these
older versions were designed for quickly setting up and running one scan the
focus is now on creating reusable scan tasks that can be saved and run many
times with no extra effort.

Toolbar Functionality
---------------------
The main toolbar is located just below the window’s title bar, underneath the
“Scan Tasks” heading. The toolbar provides a single location for managing
and starting your scan tasks and (on the right hand side) for accessing more
information about the software.

These are the most important buttons on the toolbar:

- Start Task: Runs the task that is currently highlighted in the list below.

- New: Opens the New Task window where you can create a new task to use many times.

- Edit: Opens the Edit Task window so that the currently selected task can  be modified.

- Delete: Removes the currently selected scan task from the list.

Task List
---------
The task list displays your scan tasks; select one from the list and the Start
Task, Edit and Delete buttons on the toolbar and their corresponding functions
will become available.

A new task can be created at any time, while a task cannot be started, edited or deleted
while it is running.

Since 2.1.2 scan tasks support ’profile roaming’, that is, your scan tasks will
be stored within your user profile so that they are available on any computer
where EduSweep is installed. Changes you make on one computer will be
seamlessly transferred to any other computer you log on to.

Toolbar
-------
EduSweep has far more functionality than just basic scanning, however none
of it should get in the way of what it does best and so the additional features
have been grouped together at the bottom of the window.
