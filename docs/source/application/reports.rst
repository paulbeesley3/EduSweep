Report Management
#################

Reports are produced each time a scan task completes successfully (though
this can be disabled, see Report Settings). A report is an HTML document that
provides a summary of the task along with a list of detected files and the task
log which provides technical information. These report files are managed from
and displayed in the Report Manager window which provides easy access to
common tasks such as printing and deleting reports.

The toolbar along the top of the window provides buttons to access the functions
listed above as well as the “Open in Browser” button that launches your
default browser to display the selected report full-screen.
Though you can delete reports manually it may be preferable to enable autodeletion
which is configurable from the Settings window.
