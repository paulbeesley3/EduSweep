Signatures & Signature Elements
###############################

Signatures in EduSweep work much the same as those in commercial antivirus
packages; you can turn them on and off to detect more or fewer items.
Over 40 signatures are installed by default; some of these are very specific and
some are more general. Select a signature and use the View Details button to
see what it detects.

Having many different types of signatures allows you to detect as many or as
few file types as you like. You could, for example, enable the “Windows Scripts”
signature while leaving the “Web Scripts” signature disabled. This detects potentially
dangerous VBS files whilst ignoring JavaScript files and PHP scripts
that are useful for web design courses.
