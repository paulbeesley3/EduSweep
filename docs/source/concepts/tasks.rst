Scan Tasks
##########

Tasks are a key concept when using EduSweep; they define the directories
that will be scanned as well as the signatures that will be used to detect unwanted
files.Each tasks is self-contained so, for example, several tasks could
be created with each scanning the same folder yet searching for different file
types.

Since every network has a different layout, EduSweep comes with no tasks
and one of the first steps taken when setting up the software is to create one.
This is achieved through the New Task window, accessible from the toolbar on
the main window.
