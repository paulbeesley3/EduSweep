Running a Scan
##############

Running a scan task is as easy as selecting it from the list on the main window
and either clicking the “Start Task” button on the toolbar or double-clicking the
list entry. The scan window will appear and the scan will begin to run immediately.
You can pause or stop the scan at any point using the buttons on the
bottom-right side of the window.

If you are using Windows 7 then EduSweep will report the progress of the scan
task in the Windows taskbar. While the task is starting, the taskbar will display
an indeterminate (marquee) progress bar and when the scan has started a
regular progress bar is used to inform you of the scan progress even when
EduSweep is minimised.

The scan window is made up of four tabs - Overview, Locations, Results and
Log. The most often used tabs are Overview and Results since these allow the
scan progress to be observed and the results to be dealt with.
