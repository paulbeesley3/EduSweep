Standard Uninstallation
#######################

EduSweep can be removed, like any other MSI package, from the Add/Remove
Programs entry in Control Panel (Programs and Features for Windows Vista,
7, 2008). It is listed under EduSweep 2.5 in the programs list.

Alternatively it is possible to start the uninstallation process using the Uninstall
entry in the EduSweep folder of the Start Menu. The end result is the same as
uninstalling via the Control Panel.
