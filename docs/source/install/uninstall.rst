Uninstallation
##############

Standard Uninstallation
-----------------------
EduSweep can be removed from the Apps and Features page of the Settings application
(Windows 10) or from the Programs and Features control panel entry (Windows 7 or 8).

Alternatively, it is possible to start the uninstallation process directly by executing the
unins000.exe file in the root of the EduSweep install directory.

Removal of User Data
--------------------
EduSweep stores user data into a working folder during its use. By default this is the
%appdata%\EduSweep directory, part of the user's roaming Windows profile.

This data includes scan tasks, reports, quarantined files, etc. These files will not be
removed when EduSweep is uninstalled (except when the installation was portable, see
below). It is safe to remove this data manually after the uninstallation is complete, if
desired.

Portable Uninstallation
-----------------------
To remove a portable installation simply delete the portable application folder in which
the EduSweep application files are installed. For example,
if the install path is D:\Apps\EduSweep then deleting the EduSweep directory is
sufficient to completely remov e all program files and user data.

Because user data in a portable installation is stored under the same directory as the
program files this data will be completely removed as well.
