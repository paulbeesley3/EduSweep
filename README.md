EduSweep is a tool to keep IT networks - especially those in an education environment - free of unwanted files that anti-malware
software doesnâ€™t search for.

Use EduSweep to identify and remove files that contravene your acceptable usage policy, that take up too much space or may
be vectors for malicious code. Unmask technology - powered by TrIDLib - can reveal a file's true content type even when the file
extension has been modified.

Repeatable scan tasks make management easy, while built-in reporting tools offer evidence collection and tracking. See what
files are hiding on your network's file stores and take appropriate action with the quarantine functionality.

## Versioning

EduSweep follows a MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH versioning structure. Because the version applies to an application and not
to an API the versioning is not quite in line with the  [Semantic Versioning](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/)
standard. Nonetheless, it follows a similar pattern.

MAJOR: A change to the application that breaks previously-generated application files (such as scan tasks or signatures).

MINOR: A change that adds features or modifies application behaviour in a backwards-compatible manner.

PATCH: A bug fix release that does not alter the application's functionality in any meaningful way.
